Turned 4-5 to 5-4
Lord of war, now ponder
How to send dogs six down under
With rain come the clap of thunder
Soaked every eye glued on moi
But lost all my passion for war
Light lays placed next to me on the floor
Shadows from me run for the door
Daily I radiate more
Know on a date not too far
When cornered I will devour
Those who, in final hour
Full of power over I'll tower
