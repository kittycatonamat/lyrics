Turned 4-5 to 5-4
Lord of war, now ponder
How to send other dog down under
With rain come the clap of thunder
I've soaked every eye glued on moi
But lost all my passion for war
Light lays placed next to me on the floor
Shadows from me run through the door
Daily I radiate more
Know on a date not too far
When they corner me I'll devour
Those who, in the final hour
Over, full of power, I'll tower
