Turned 4-5 to 5-4
Of war I'm the lord, now ponder
How to send other deep down under
With rain come the clap of thunder
I've soaked every eye glued on moi
But lost all my passion for war
Light next to me lays placed on the floor
Shadows from me run through the door
Daily I radiate more
Know on a date not too far
When they corner me I will devour
Those who with me in the final hour
